# Cloning

This only applies if you are building VMs.

I can clone the Promox instance **pve21** created in the getting started section. Make sure **pve21** is shut down. Now clone it as **pve22** and **pve23**.

With basic Linux skills I can change configuration files to create pve22 and 23.

## Manual Changes

1. Edit /etc/hostname
2. Change the startup message in /etc/issue
3. Change the IPv4 address and host name in /etc/hosts
4. Edit /etc/network/interfaces&#x20;
