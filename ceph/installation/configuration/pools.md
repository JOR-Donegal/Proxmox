# Pools

Before I can use this new storage, I need to create a pool. For our purposes, a pool is logical storage with particular properties.

In Ceph->Pools I click to create a pool.

In a production environment, we would have three copies of our data, and a minimum of 2 copies.

Click create and then check to make sure its done.

Finished!

Now I can create VM, live migrate, etc.
