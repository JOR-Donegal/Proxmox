# Single Server

In these notes, I am going to work my way through building a Proxmox cluster, end to end.

In real applications, we will rarely use a single server in any scenario. I teach that as a possibility for SMEs, only because enterprise tools are so expensive. However, with Proxmox, we get to build a cluster with some enterprise functionality, for free.

In my examples, I use Promox VMs installed in VMWare Workstation, that is a good way to start. Always go through this process BEFORE you work on bare metal hosts.
