# Cloning

This only applies if you are building VMs.&#x20;

If you are working on bare metal hosts, skip this page.

I can clone the Promox instance **pve21** created in the getting started section. I will need these clones for clustering.&#x20;

Make sure **pve21** is shut down. Now clone it as **pve31**, **pve32** and **pve33** and leave them for later.
