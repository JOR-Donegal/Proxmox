# Upload an image

ISO images can be kept in the local stare of any server.

In my configuration, I have only half the 9GB store still available, enough!

I select ISO images and Upload. I'm using ub22.04 as it is 1GB smaller than 24.04.

I verify the image is uploaded.

Note that as this image is stored on a pve31 local store, it is only available on this server.&#x20;
